### The project

I created this page to practice using modal (pop-up window).
The user can click on any of the 3 buttons on the page, where it says "show modal".
After clicking, the pop-up window opens and to close it, the user can click the "X" or just press the ESC key.
All these interactions were developed using JavaScript.
